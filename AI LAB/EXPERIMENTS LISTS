ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE LAB 

Name of the Experiment:- 

1 Provide the PEAS description and TASK Environment for a given AI problem.

2 Identify suitable Agent Architecture for the problem

3 Write simple programs using PROLOG as an AI programming Language

4 Implement any one of the Uninformed search techniques

5 Implement any one of the Informed search techniques E.g. A-Star algorithm for 8 puzzle problem

6 Implement adversarial search using min-max algorithm.

7 Implement any one of the Local Search techniques. E.g. Hill Climbing, Simulated Annealing, Genetic algorithm

8 Prove the goal sentence from the following set of statements in FOPL by applying forward, backward and resolution inference algorithms.
